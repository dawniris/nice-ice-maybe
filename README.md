# nice-ice-maybe
sweet, sweet poetry (possibly)

## the why
don't _you_ get all _your_ best app ideas on Friday afternoon at Ruby on Ales?

## the how
First create a local clone of the _nice-ice-maybe_ repo, then `cd` into that directory and execute the following five rake tasks:

```
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake populate_lyric_db
bundle exec rake load_images_db
bundle exec rake populate_quote_db
```

Note that in order to load images, you'll have to set up your own .env file with Bing credentials.

Now spin up a local Rails server with `bundle exec rails s` and poem to your heart's content by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser of choice (i.e. not IE).

## parting thoughts
